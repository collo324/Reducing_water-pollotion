State of Nature layers for Water Availability and Water Pollution to support SBTN Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize

There are multiple well-recognized and peer-reviewed global datasets that can be used to assess water availability and water pollution. Each of these datasets are based on different inputs, modeling approaches, and assumptions. Therefore, in SBTN Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize, companies are required to consult different global datasets for a robust and comprehensive State of Nature (SoN) assessment for water availability and water pollution. 
To streamline this process, WWF, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and SBTN worked together to develop two ready-to-use unified layers of SoN – one for water availability and one for water pollution – in line with the Technical Guidance for Steps 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The result is a single file (shapefile) containing the maximum value both for water availability and for water pollution, as well as the datasets’ raw values (as references). This data is publicly available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7797979 . See the data’s columns and description in the Appendix.
These unified layers will make it easier for companies to implement a robust approach, and they will lead to more aligned and comparable results between companies. A temporary App is available at https://arcg.is/0z9mOD0 to help companies assess the SoN for water availability and water pollution around their operations and supply chain locations. In the future, these layers will become available both in the WRI’s Aqueduct and in the WWF Risk Filter Suite.

For the SoN for water availability, the following datasets were considered:
Baseline water stress (Hofste et al. 2019), data available here 
Water depletion (Brauman et al. 2016), data available here 
Blue water scarcity (Mekonnen & Hoekstra 2016), data upon request to the authors 
For the SoN for water pollution, the following datasets were considered:
Coastal Eutrophication Potential (Hofste et al. 2019), data available here
Nitrate-Nitrite Concentration (Damania et al. 2019), data available here 
Periphyton Growth Potential (McDowell et al. 2020), data available here 

In general, the same processing steps were performed for all datasets:  
Compute the area-weighted median of each dataset at a common spatial resolution, i.e. HydroSHEDS HydroBasins Level 6 in this case.
Classify datasets to a common range as reclassifying raw values to 1-5 values, where 0 (zero) was used for cells or features with no data. See the thresholds used for each dataset on the next pages. These were dataset’s authors definitions and/or recommendations. 
Identify the maximum value between the classified datasets, separately, for Water Availability and for Water Pollution.

For transparency and reproducibility, the code is publicly available at https://github.com/rafaexx/sbtn-SoN-water

Baseline water stress (Hofste et al. 2019), data available here
The WRI’s Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total surface and groundwater withdrawals to available renewable water. This indicator is based on model outputs from PCR-GLOBWB 2 to compute average monthly values, for the period 1960-2014, then to produce regression values for the year 2014 (baseline). 
Raw values were classified as follows:
Raw value

> 0.1 – 0.2

2
> 0.2 – 0.4
Medium - High

Water depletion (Brauman et al. 2016), data available here
Water depletion measures the ratio of surface and ground water consumptive use to available renewable water. This indicator is based on model outputs from WaterGAP3 to compute average annual and monthly values, for the period 1971-2000, and to map seasonal depletion and dry-year depletion.
Raw values were classified as follows:
Raw value
Label
New value
1
≤ 5% annual depletion

> 5 – 25% annual depletion

> 25 – 75% annual depletion and at least 3 out of 30 years had at least one month with monthly depletion ratio >75% (Dry-Year)

> 25 – 75% annual depletion and at least one month every year the monthly depletion ratio is >75% (Seasonal)

> 75 – 100% annual depletion

8
> 100% annual depletion

Blue water scarcity (Mekonnen & Hoekstra 2016), data upon request to the authors
Blue water scarcity measures the ratio of the blue water footprint to the total blue water availability. This indicator is based on the global standard for water footprint assessment to compute average monthly values and an annual average value (10-year average for the period 1996-2005).
Raw values were classified as follows:
Raw value

Coastal Eutrophication Potential (Hofste et al. 2019), data available here
Coastal eutrophication potential measures the potential for riverine loadings of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) to stimulate harmful algal blooms in coastal waters.
Raw values were classified as follows:

Nitrate-Nitrite Concentration (Damania et al. 2019), data available here
Nitrate-Nitrite Concentration is based on a combination of monitoring data and a machine learning prediction model. Here we used the average predicted values between 2006 and 2010, i.e. the last 5 years of available data.
Raw values were classified as follows:

Periphyton Growth Potential (McDowell et al. 2020), data available here
Periphyton Growth Potential is based on global model of dissolved and total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and ratios to determine which nutrient is limiting periphyton proliferation during the growing season. 
Raw values were classified as follows, i.e., a similar classification as in the original publication, however, using more thresholds:

N:P ratio < 7 and N < 0.4 – 0.8
